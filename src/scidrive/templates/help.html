			The share ID can be used to provide access to the share for console scripts. To get the OAuth token for shared container, the "share" parameter should be added to request_token and authorize OAuth URLs:
			<p><code>http://server/vospace-2.0/request_token?share=&lt;share_id&gt;</code></p>
			<p><code>http://server/vospace-2.0/authorize?provider=vao&share=&lt;share_id&gt;</code></p>
			When accessing the authorize URL with anonymous share ID, no user acton is needed. The URL can be queried by the script in automatic mode, as described here: <a href="https://github.com/dimm0/scidrive/wiki/Using-Dropbox-SDK" target="_blank">https://github.com/idies/scidrive/wiki/Using-Dropbox-SDK</a>
